summary: "Happiness was never about following in the footsteps of all of those who came before you, it was never about being like the others"

You’re going to realize it one day — that happiness was never about your job,  
or your degree, or being in a relationship.  
Happiness was never about following in the footsteps of all of those who came before you,  
it was never about being like the others. One day, you’re going to see it  
that happiness was always about the discovery, the hope, the listening to your  
heart and following it wherever it chose to go.  
Happiness was always about being kinder to yourself,  
it was always about embracing the person you were becoming. One day, you will understand.

That happiness was always about learning how to live with yourself,  
that happiness was never in the hands of other people. It was always about you.  
It was always about you.
