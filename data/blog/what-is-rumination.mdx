summary: "A belief is what you know to be true because experience has made it evident to you. If you want to change your life, change your beliefs"

Imagine when a cow eats He chews, swallows, regurgitates and re-chews the same piece of grass over and over again.

This can be the same as what we do with thoughts. Just chewing over the same idea or issue or worry again and again and again. Ask yourself, am I problem solving or just chewing like a cow

Note to self
A belief is what you know to be true because experience has made it evident to you. If you want to change your life, change your beliefs. If you want to change your beliefs, go out and have new experiences that make them real to you. Not the opposite way around.
